# Declaring Decorators Module

Common tasks like write to a log file (aka logging) is done by using decorators. Some obvious cases for writing decorators include:

* log function call or metadata to file
* find execution time
* DB transactions
* authentication requirements
* parsing arguments (cleaning/pre-processing inputs)

## Installation

Use "pip install decdec" to get the module and you can use template decorators.
