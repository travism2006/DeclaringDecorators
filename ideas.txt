Main Intentions/Primary Goal(s):
 - make boilerplate code for typical cases of using decorators more easily accessible
 - ID all decorators in a file
 - make decorators iterable via list in a different way
 - decorators can be compared (based on function's memory)
 - decorators can be added (same operation as writing on 2+ lines) or subtracted (aspect included = exclusion if subtraction)


Secondary Things/Goals:
 - css capable -> you can add css styles/html code to have a html file generated using the file .py's html/css code
 - ID all decorators in multiple files (non-directories)
 - ID all decorators in a folder (excluding sub-directories)
 - ID all decorators in a folder (including sub-directories)
